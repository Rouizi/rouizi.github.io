In this project, I learned how to do 3D object detection, tracking, and visualization using LiDAR and camera data.

## [Stereo Depth Estimation](https://github.com/Rouizi/stereo-depth-estimation)

![](assets/images/streo_depth_estimation.gif)

This project explores **stereo vision** techniques for depth estimation.
It covers camera calibration, disparity map generation, depth map computation, and obstacle detection in 3D from stereo images.

## [Visual Fusion](https://github.com/Rouizi/visual-fusion)
