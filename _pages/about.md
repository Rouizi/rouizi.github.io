I’m a **3D Perception Engineer** focused on building advanced AI systems that understand the world through depth, geometry, and multi-sensor fusion.

I’ve implemented state-of-the-art models like **PointNet** from scratch for point cloud classification and segmentation, and I specialize in **3D object detection and tracking, BEV transformation, and sensor fusion**. My experience covers **LiDAR, stereo vision, point cloud processing**, and solutions such as **lane detection** on LiDAR data, **Point-Pixel fusion** (early fusion), and **Box-to-Box fusion** (late fusion). I’ve also worked on **Kalman filter–based tracking**.

I’m passionate about applying cutting-edge research to real-world challenges in autonomous driving, robotics, and spatial AI.

I’m seeking freelance or full-time opportunities where I can contribute deep expertise in 3D perception and sensor fusion to build smarter machines that see and understand their environment.
