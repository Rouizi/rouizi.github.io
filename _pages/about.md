I’m a 3D Perception Engineer focused on building advanced AI systems that understand the world through depth, geometry, and multi-sensor fusion.

I’ve implemented state-of-the-art models like 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗡𝗲𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 for point cloud classification and segmentation. My experience spans 𝟯𝗗 𝗼𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗕𝗘𝗩 (𝗕𝗶𝗿𝗱’𝘀 𝗘𝘆𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄) 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, and working extensively with 𝗟𝗶𝗗𝗔𝗥, 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗼 𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁 𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴. I’ve developed solutions such as 𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗶𝗗𝗔𝗥 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮, early fusion approaches like 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁-𝗣𝗶𝘅𝗲𝗹 𝗙𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻, and late fusion techniques including 𝗕𝗼𝘅-𝘁𝗼-𝗕𝗼𝘅 𝗙𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻. My projects also include 𝗰𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗮 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 and bicycle tracking using 𝗞𝗮𝗹𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿.

I’m passionate about applying cutting-edge research to real-world challenges in autonomous driving, robotics, and spatial AI.

I’m seeking freelance or full-time opportunities where I can contribute deep expertise in 3D perception, sensor fusion, and 3D vision to build smarter machines that see and understand their environment.
